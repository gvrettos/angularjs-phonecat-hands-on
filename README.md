# angularjs-phonecat-hands-on

## Introduction

This introductory demo application on AngularJS is based on the PhoneCat App Tutorial App provided in the [official docs](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial). The final app is a catalog that displays a list of phone devices that may display a detailed view for each device.

If your intention is to create an AngularJS from scratch you are encouraged to use [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) as a starting point.

My goal for this project was to have hands-on experience of a simple AngularJS application in order to grasp the basic concepts. A commit-by-commit approach was followed that illustrates the breakdown of the building steps. Design enhancements (CSS) were not considered too much, as it was done in the original project. 

You are more than welcome to contribute to the stylistic design of this app. :smile:

## Installation and usage
* Make sure you have a [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installation available. If not, prefer to download an LTS version from the official website. The version tested is v10.14.2
* Go to directory where package.json is located and run:
  * npm install --> It will download all declared node modules and their transitive dependencies 
  * npm start --> The angularjs web server will load on localhost:8000. Access the app by typing localhost:8000/app on the browser
  * npm run unit-tests
  * npm run e2e-tests
